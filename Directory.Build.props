          +---------+
      
      **************************************************************


      14.5.2
      - Added PXK-Clock Promo Message on first FSI evaluation (when logs are enabled)

      14.5.1
      - Fixed untracked bug: using config_useBaseUrl as http template won't crash when printing unfinished requests

      14.5.0
      - Added 'useBaseUrl' and 'transformUrl' to Config for better composability
      - Fixed some extension methods

      14.4.2
      - Thanks @bartelink
        Pinned FSharp.Core to 5.0.2 in all library projects
        Removed net7.0, net8.0 TFM-specific builds
        Lots of other cool stability-oriented stuff and detail-work

      14.4.1
      - Fixed missing explicit dependency on FSharp.Core

      14.4.0
      - Fixed pre-configured requests

      14.3.0
      - Added `GetList` JsonElement extension
      
      14.2.0
      - (Breaking change) Separated Config and PrintHint (...and many more things in these domains)

      14.1.0
      - (Breaking change) Renamed `Extensions.To...Enumerable` to `Extensions.To...Seq`
      - Added `toJsonList...` overloads

      14.0.0
      - (Breaking change) Renamed types in Domain:
        BodyContent -> SinglepartContent
        RequestContent -> BodyContent
        FsHttpUrl -> FsHttpTarget
      - (Breaking change) FsHttpUrl (now FsHttpTarget) and Header restructured: method, address and queryParams are now part of the FsHttpTarget type.
      - Added `headerTransformers` to Config for better composability

      13.3.0
      - (Breaking change) All `Response._TAsync` functions (task based) in F# require a CancellationToken now.
      - (Breaking change) Extension methods rework
      - (Breaking change) There's no more StartingContext, which means:
        we give up a little bit of safety here, for the sake of pre-configuring HTTP requests
        without specifying the URL. This is a trade-off we are willing to take.

      12.2.0
      - added HttpMethods for better composability

      12.1.0
      - net8.0

      12.0.0
      - #137 / #102: Change the type for FsHttpUrl.additionalQueryParams from obj to string
      - Removed (auto opened) Async.await and Task.map/await
      - Moved (auto opened) Async.map to FsHttp.Helper.Async.map

      11.1.0
      - #130 / #105: Add method for user-supplied cancellation token

      11.0.0
      - #121 (Breaking change): Turning off debug logs in FSI (breaking change in signature / namespace)
      - #124: Support Repeating Query Parameters (thanks @DaveJohnson8080)
      - #106 (Breaking change): Allow filename metadata with other "parts" (thanks @dawedawe)
      - Breaking change: ContentTypeForPart custom operations should come after part definition
      - #104 (Breaking change): Automatic GZip response decompression per Default
      - Other breaking changes:
        - Removed `ContentTypeWithEncoding` and used optional `charset` parameter in `ContentType` overloads.
        - Renamed `byteArray` to `binary` in Dsl, DslCE and CSharp.
        - Caution (!!): Renamed `stringPart` to `textPart` and changed argument order for `name` and `value` in Dsl and DslCE.
        - Restructured types in Domain
        - `Helper` is a module instead of a namespace, and some things were moved.
        - All transformers in config are a list of transformers instead of a single item.
        - Removed `setHttpClient`. Please use `setHttpClientFactory` instead.
        - `setHttpClientFactory` takes a `Config` as input argument.
